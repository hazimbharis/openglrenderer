this is a post-it note for how to rebuild the opengl tutorial that im still following

- um, I think open run cmake
- there should are already be a cmake thing/txt file in the folder
- umm, open mingw64 I think or ucrt64, I think that one works too
- run this whenever you make a change to the source files so that it updates the executables
